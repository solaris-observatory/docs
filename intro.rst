The Solaris Observatory is a scientific and technological project aimed
at developing a smart solar monitoring system at high radio frequencies,
based on single-dish imaging techniques. It involves the implementation
of a dedicated and interchangeable 100 GHz receiver on small radio
telescopes (1.5-2.6 m class).

The observatory is designed for operations in Antarctica, which offers
unique observing conditions: very low sky opacity and long solar exposure
times. It enables unprecedented monitoring of the Sun in the radio W-band
through state-of-the-art single-dish imaging techniques. These allow
full-disk solar maps to be obtained in under 30 minutes, with a spatial
resolution of a few arcminutes, opening up up the possibility of identifying
and performing spectral analysis of active regions before, during, and
after solar flares. The system's capabilities allows Solaris to
investigate cutting-edge aspects of solar physics (e.g., dynamic
monitoring of the chromosphere) and applications in space weather
(e.g., flare forecasting).

The Solaris Observatory will be the only solar facility offering
continuous monitoring at 100 GHz and will collect and disseminate data
in synergy with national and international space weather monitoring networks.
